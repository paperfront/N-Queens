# N-Queens

I made this program for a personal physics project, in which I attempt to analyze different heuristics for creating solutions to the N-Queens Problem

This program does not yield all solutions to the problem for a given value of N, but instead yields N solutions.

Planning on editing code to make it more readable. Currently, the two files utilize poor naming conventions, and lack commenting.

Fixes to come soon.
